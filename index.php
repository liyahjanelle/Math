Explanation:The relevance of our design to the theme HOPE, is about to cherish a desire with anticipation. Our drawing depicts that we are stronger together and we have confidence. Itâ€™s also like holding the hands of your friend through thick and thin. When we are together, we are giving hopes to other people also our self. Being one with the other people means giving confidence and hope to each other.
